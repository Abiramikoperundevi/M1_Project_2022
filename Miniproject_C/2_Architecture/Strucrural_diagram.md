# Structural Diagram
  
  
  * Structural Diagrams Structure diagrams depict the static structure of the elements in your system. i.e., how one object relates to another. 
  * It shows the things in the system – classes, objects, packages or modules, physical nodes, components, and interfaces.

  * In the above diagram describe the structural and behaviour diagram 
  * Structure diagrams depict the static structure of the elements in your system. i.e., how one object relates to another. It shows the things in 
    the system – classes, objects, packages or modules, physical nodes, components, and interfaces. 
  * For example, just as the static aspects of a house encompass the existence and placement of such things as walls, doors, windows, pipes, wires, and vents. 
  * The Seven UML structural diagrams are roughly organized around the major groups of things you’ll find when modeling a system.

  * Since structure diagrams represent the structure, they are used extensively in documenting the software architecture of software systems.

  * For example, the component diagram describes how a software system is split up into components and shows the dependencies among these components.



* Structural Diagram	         -    Brief Description
* Composite Structure Diagram	 -    It shows the internal structure of a classifier, classifier interactions with the environment through ports, or behavior of a 
                                    collaboration.
* Deployment Diagram	         -    It shows a set of nodes and their relationships that illustrates the static deployment view of an architecture.
* Package Diagram              -    It groups related UML elements into a collection of logically related UML structure.
* Profile Diagram	 
* Class Diagram	               -    It shows a set of classes, interfaces, and collaborations and their relationships, typically, found in modeling object-oriented systems.
* Object Diagram	             -    It shows a set of objects and their relationships, which is the static snapshots of instances of the things found in class diagrams.

    * The content detailily describes the structural diagram, in my project there is no inter relation betweem the function blocks and also i am not use any 
      classes, database etc so there is impossible of structural diagram for COVID TRACKING SYSTEM
