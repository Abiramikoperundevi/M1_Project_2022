# Multifile Programming
* Industry projects opten have 5000 to 5 millions of Source lines of Code. And writing everything under one sinlge file is not reader frindly and also it is easy to get lost. 
* A simple solution is to divide the code into multiple files.

    * Main division in that multifile is for Header file 
    * Header files are placed in inc
    * function calling process are used in that multifile so it is placed in src
    * Along with that I can use unity file for testing
