*Test cases are decided with the help of 
        
        
      *Total Cases
      *Active Cases
      *Recovered Cases
      *Death Cases
      *First dosage count
      *Second dosage count
      
  

* In my project covid details and vaccinated details are entered by the user and it will diplays through the covid status and vaccinated status
* I covered the covid cases details for the southern states so I choose four state i.e. Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Andra Pradesh in that instead of state name I gave a number for the state.
* If the given number for the states are mismatched means it will diplays the invalid case
* If the given count for active cases, recovered cases, death cases should not be execeed then Total cases.
* Second dosage count should not be execeed then the first dosage count.
* The above two cases are must to maintain.
* These are our test plans
