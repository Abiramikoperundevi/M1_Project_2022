# COVID TRACKING SYSTEM
A System is associated with following attributes:
```
  Total cases
  Active cases
  Recovered cases
  Death cases
  First dose
  Second dose
```
### Write seperate functions to perform the following operations:
* Create an Structure for covid details using dynamic memory
* Add Southern state names in the form of number.
* Display the Covid status according to the state number
* Total cases, Active cases, Recovered cases, Death cases those details are given by user
* If the details are entered, then the system automatically display through the covid status block.
* Create an structure for vaccinated details using dynamic memory
* Add Southern state names in the form of number.
* Display the Covid status according to the state number
* First dose and second dose count those details are given by user
* If the details are entered, then the system automatically display through the Vaccinated status block
* if we given an another set of information means it will be automatically added with the preivous count and Update automatically.

## Guidelines
* Use dynamic memory allocation for structures.
* Return appropriate results from all the functions.
* Follow Modular programming and multifile approach
* Create Makefile with targets for compiling and testing, analysis and coverage.
* Follow best practices while writing the code.
